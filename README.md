## Assumptions
- User should enter the correct input type
- Before scheduling an event it is  assumed that attraction is closed.
- As clarified on gc most visited attraction is the most popular one.
- As clarified on gc total visitors = basic + premium members and not registered members
- Premium members get only one free access to the attraction
- For a particular number of tickets only one special deal can be made
- Visitors can only see attractions that are open
- Visitor can not visit animals and attractions before buying membership
- If there are multiple attractions with same number of visits any one is shown to the admin
- Discount code is same as the discount name

## OOPS concepts
- Object class- tostring implemented in different classes
- Polymorphism used in animals
- Inheritance in animals
- Interfaces made
- Function names already named in a way to explain what they are doing
